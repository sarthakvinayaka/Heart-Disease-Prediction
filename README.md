# Heart Disease Prediction:
## Problem Description:
**This project is to just show some of the steps that could be taken analyzing a dataset and prediction using the heart disease dataset.**


## Steps Involved:
- Importing Libraries
- Uploading  dataset
- Analyze dataset 
- Building model
- Training model and validating model
- Conclusion


## Libraries Required:
- Sklearn 
- Matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy
- Seaborn
- scipy
- keras
## **Dataset description**
Data set can be downloaded by following [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
The dataset that we will be using is a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository via a Kaggle competition. The data has been provided by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The dataset consists of patients ranging in age from 29 - 77 years old. There are a total of 303 instances and 14 attributes including our target variable of “presence” of heart disease. 

**Attributes**


1.   sex:     sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
2.   age:     age in years
3.   cp :     chest pain type
4.   trestb:  psresting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5.   chol:    serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.   fbs:     (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
7.   restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
8.   thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
9.   exang:   exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10.  oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.  slope:   The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12.  ca:      Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13.  thal:    3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14.  target:  1 or 0 (0: No Disease, 1: Disease)
